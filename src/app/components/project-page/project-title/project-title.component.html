                This is a NPM package that takes an SVG file and renders it as a inline SVG to the DOM and can also
                render
                HTML files too. You can also pass data to it that render double curly braces. I created this to solve
                problems with some frameworks and bundlers when using inline SVG files and to keep code clean an easier
                to
                read.
